# pythonAT1

Our local school, Gowan Brae Public School, has asked us to produce a
program, written in Python, which performs the following tasks:


● Upon opening the program, it prints the title of the program followed
by a blank line.


● asks for a password or login number and checks against pre-set
passwords or numbers (These should be commented in your code)


● if the password is not accepted, it allows the user two more attempts
before closing the program with an appropriate message


● if the password is accepted, takes the user to a main menu


● sets up a class test score system for teachers to track class scores -
there are four classes (Class names of your choice).

● 1st menu item: Enter 1 class worth of scores, there should be at least
10 Students in each class.


● 2nd menu item: Print out the information for each student in a class:
o Student Last name
o Student First name
o Score the student


● 3rd menu item: Edit the scores for an entire class, or a particular
student in the class.


● 4th Grades students into bands of a class into bands then displays
the results:
A Grade &gt;= 90 Marks
B Grade &gt;= 80 Marks
C Grade &gt;= 70 Marks
D Grade &gt;= 60 Marks
P Grade &gt;= 50 Marks
E Grade &lt; 50 Marks


● 5th Calculate the percentage of students who achieved a particular
grade.


● 6th menu item: quits the program

Task Notes

● all control structures and calculation lines of code must be
appropriately commented


● all variables must be named in a meaningful way


● you may be asked to explain any part of your algorithm


● use functions wherever possible (avoiding repeated code)


● any extensions to the above tasks you add to the program to
enhance the functionality (such as saving to a text file which will be
read when the program is re-run; or, displaying ranked positions of
students) will be awarded marks allocated from an additional
possible 10


● a list of any enhancements you’ve included must be placed as
comments at the start of the program
